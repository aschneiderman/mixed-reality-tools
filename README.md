# Mixed Reality Tools and Development Platforms

Here are some of the tools [Mixed Reality for All](https://makersall.org/making-ar-more-accessible/) might use:

- [Unity]()
- [WebVR]()  (soon to be known as WebXR)
- [Miscellaneous]() tools

## Unity

[Unity](https://unity3d.com/)is a 3D gaming engine that Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and others support for designing VR and AR. Unity is very powerful, there are lots of tutorials and other support, and there are a lot of free or cheap "assets" -- e.g., 3D objects -- that are easily available. And Unity's development editor is very customizable. However, there are several drawbacks to using Unity:

- Unity is a proprietary system -- and it's a pretty complex system
-  Most Unity projects require coding, and Unity uses the programming language C#. C# has a pretty steep learning curve.
- Deploying what you built on Unity can be a real pain in the butt. For example, to build an AR project for an iPhone, you need to have Xcode 9 running on your computer, and Xcode 9 only runs on MacOS.


## WebVR

[WebVR](https://webvr.info/) is

Advantages:

- Don't have to download a separate app
- Eventually, can create seamless transition between web and VR/AR experience
- Large, robust community
- All open source
- Designed to encourage
- Linkable, searchable, etc.
- For coding, uses JavaScript
- Doesn't require access to the Internet; it's all JavaScript plus web GL, so you can run it off of a USB stick

Doesn't include AR just yet, but coming in the near future

## Miscellaneous Tools

- Expeditions VR (Does it include Expeditions AR yet?)
- Sketchfab: create and share 3D models
